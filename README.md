# Heavenly Pizza Website

## by Ethan Firpo

## Description

This website allows a user to place an order for a pizza and calculates the price based upon their selection. It alters prices based upon size of pizza, meat selections, number of toppings, type of sauce, and type of crust. Created to test my ability to create objects using JavaScript constructors and alter those objects using prototypes.
